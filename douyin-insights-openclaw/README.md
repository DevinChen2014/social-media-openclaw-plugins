# Douyin 抖音 Content Insights MCP

This directory contains an OpenClaw native plugin shim for the hosted Douyin Insights MCP service.

The plugin registers namespaced OpenClaw tools and forwards each call to a remote, read-only `streamable-http` MCP endpoint:

- Endpoint: `https://mcp.52choujiang.com/douyin/mcp`
- API key environment variable: `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY`
- Product: `SocialDataX` / `社媒数据助手`
- Website: <https://socialdatax.com>
- Package name: `douyin-insights-openclaw-plugin`
- Version: `0.2.4`
- Search terms: Douyin, 抖音, social media research, Douyin content insights, hot search, video and image/text works, creator analytics, comments, comment replies, creator profiles, creator short-drama series

## Capabilities

The hosted Douyin MCP supports read-only social media intelligence workflows:

- Search related Douyin works by keyword.
- Fetch the current Douyin main hot search list.
- Resolve Douyin content page links, short links, share text, or aweme IDs into structured details.
- Fetch work details, first-level comments, and comment replies.
- Read creator profile information.
- Fetch creator work lists for content style and account research.
- Fetch creator short-drama series lists.

The service does not provide account login, posting, editing, liking, commenting, or other account actions.

## Plugin Structure

This package uses the native OpenClaw plugin path:

- `openclaw.plugin.json` declares the native plugin manifest and tool contracts.
- `package.json` declares the OpenClaw extension entry and MCP SDK dependency.
- `index.js` registers thin forwarding tools that call the hosted MCP service.
- Runtime metadata declares the required `node` binary, `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY`, and the hosted MCP service domain.

It intentionally does not include `.codex-plugin/` or `.mcp.json`, because OpenClaw gives `openclaw.plugin.json` native-plugin precedence when both marker types are present.

## API Key

Set the shared API key before using this plugin:

```bash
export SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY="<SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY>"
```

The key is sent as:

```text
Authorization: Bearer ${SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY}
```

The plugin sends the key only to the fixed endpoint `https://mcp.52choujiang.com/douyin/mcp`. It does not support overriding the endpoint URL.

Do not commit real API keys to code, docs, issues, or screenshots.

## Tool Names

The native plugin registers namespaced tool names that match the earlier MCP server prefix convention. For example, the remote MCP tool `douyin_search_videos` is exposed as:

```text
douyin-insights__douyin_search_videos
```

## Publishing Check

Use ClawHub dry-run before publishing:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use 24.13.0
clawhub package publish douyin-insights-openclaw \
  --family code-plugin \
  --name douyin-insights-openclaw-plugin \
  --display-name "Douyin 抖音 Content Insights MCP" \
  --version 0.2.4 \
  --source-repo <public-owner/public-repo> \
  --source-commit <public-commit-sha> \
  --source-path douyin-insights-openclaw \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

Publish from a public GitHub source or pass explicit public `--source-repo`, `--source-commit`, and `--source-path` values. Do not publish from a private source checkout.
